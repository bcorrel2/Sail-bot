# Sail-bot

### My Story 

In 2016, as a Freshman at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I had the pleasure of attending the annual HackIllinois programming competition. 
Having just completed my foundational programming course, with no real skills to speak of, I set out to create a project I could present at the conclusion
of the competition. After finding a Library called Tweepy that allowed programs to interface with Twitter, I set out to create an automated Twitter Bot
that could be customized at deployed at scale to any number of themed Twitter accounts. As part of this project, I taught myself Python over the course of
the weekend, marking the first new programming language I learned of my own initiative. 

In 2018, as part of CS Sail, a new student recruitment initative by the UIUC CS Department, I reconfigured my initial project into Sail-bot and presented it
to prospective students. Along with the presentation was a live coding demonstation, showing atendees what could be accomplished with only a single semester
of CS education at Illinois. 

Today, Sail-bot is unfortunately no longer actively maintained. The code remains in my GitHub repository as a reminder of where I started, and a testament to legacy
this code has left within my career.
